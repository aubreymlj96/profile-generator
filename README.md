## Description
This is a command-line application that allows users to proactively generate README files based on user inputs

## Installation
-Inquirer was installed for this project and applied to the index.js file (captures user input). 

-The package-lock and package files were included to keep track of the dependences (inquirer). 

-The generateMarkdown file contributes the generation of the license badges/links, as well as the organization of the responses of the questions(data) from the index.js file. 

-The index.js file is linked to the generateMarkdown file, inquirer, and fs. The file also contributes the functionality that generates the README file itself.

-A readme is included in the utils folders as a placeholder.

-An instructions file contributes the initial user story that was included in the project guidelines.

-A readme file is included as a sample.

## Contributing
Users should be able to use the following URL for the badge creation process - https://gist.github.com/lukas-h/2a5d00690736b4c3a7ba (Tutor Trinh Nguyen assisted with providing this source so the badges would link with the license sites.)

## Tests
As an example, users can run the 'npm run test' command to ensure that there are no errors and that the application is working.
